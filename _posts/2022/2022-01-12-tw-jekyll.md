Every year I fall in love with a new documentation theme. And there is usually open licensing, but the problem is that
it's trapped behind some npm or other "state of the art" rendering nonsense that I don't want to deal with.
It's not that I'm anti-front-end bleeding edge, but for most of us that use Github for documentation, the name
of the game is Jekyll. We don't want to think about a custom workflow to make our docs, we just want to write markdown,
push to GitHub pages, and have it work. Thus I've made it a regular practice to, at least once in a while, take a beautiful theme and 
convert it into this format that can empower the researcher to make beautiful documentation. Without further delay, here is [tw-jekyll](https://github.com/vsoch/tw-jekyll). Enjoy!
